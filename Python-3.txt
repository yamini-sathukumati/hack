The Cargo Coordinates 
 

Gaaty Carriers has stepped up in digitizing their logistics. As a part of this, they wanted to locate each cargo inside a container which makes it easier for them to identify the probability of a cargo getting damaged. The cargos in the container are filled level by level, first length-wise, then breadth-wise and the coordinates start from (0,0,0).
 
Given the side length of the container, the side length a cargo and the cargo’s identification number inside the container, determine the coordinates of the cargo.
 
 Note:
1. The cargos and the container are cubical in shape.
 
Input Format :
            Input consists of 3 integers which corresponds to the side length of the container, side length of the cargo and the cargo’s identification number inside the container respectively.
 
Output Format :
            Output consists of three integers seperated by commas and enclosed in brackets. The 3 integers correspond to the x, y and z cordinates of the cargo in the container.
 
Refer to sample input and output for formatting specifications.
 
Sample Input:
15
3
108
Sample Output:
(2,1,4)

Explanation for the Sample:
Length of the container = 15.
Length of the cargo = 3.

So length-wise 5 cargos and breadth-wise 5 cargos can be arranged, and 5 such levels (heightwise) can be placed.
At the zeroth level, no. of cargos = 5*5 = 25. So after 3 levels, total cargos placed = 100.
The remaining 8 cargos in the fourth level will placed in the container as shown in the figure below.

So the co-ordinates of the 108th cargo is (2,1,4).


Program:
con=int(input())
car=int(input())
no=int(input())

a=con//car;
z=no//(a*a)
y=(no%(a*a))//a
x=((no%(a*a))%a)
if(x==0):
    x=a-1
else:
    x=x-1
print("(", x, ",", y, ",", z, ")")
